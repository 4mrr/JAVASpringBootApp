# JAVASpringBootApp

Development of a bank management web application.</br>
I use a Spring boot frameWork because Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".</br>
This application in general allows you to do banking services, as also you can add more services and change them. you're free.</br>
